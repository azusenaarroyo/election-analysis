# Election Audit with Python

## Overview of Election Audit
The Colorado Board of Election requested an election audit of the tabulated results for a U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. This audit will report the total number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate, the percentage of votes for each candidate, and the winner of the election based on the popular vote with the end goal of providing a vote-count report to certify this U.S. Congressional race. In addition, the voter turnout for each county, the percentage of votes from each county out of the total count, and the county with the highest turnout will also be reported.

### Election Audit Results
* A total of 369,711 votes were cast in this election.
* Denver County received 82.8% or 306,055 of the total votes. Jefferson County received 10.5% or 38,855 of the total votes. Arapahoe County received 6.7% of total or 24,801 of the total votes.
* Denver County had the largest number of votes.
* Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% or 11,606 of the total votes. Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% or 85,213 of the total votes. Diana DeGette received 73.8% or 272,892 of the total votes.

### Election Audit Summary
This Python script can be used for future election audits to report the outcomes listed in the "Overview of Election Audit" section. In the future, if the tabulated results are in the same three column (Ballot ID, County, Candidate) CSV file format, then there would be minor modifications needed to the file_to_load and file_to_save variables in order to yield the same results. If the tabulated results are delivered with more columns and information, then additional variables will need to be modified, like the candidate_name or county_name variables. Delivering the tabulated results in the same three column format (Ballot ID, County, Candidate) will help streamline the process in the future. However, if more data or insights are needed, then the script can be edited to satisfy those requirements.
