# Election Audit with Python

## Overview of Election Audit

This audit will report:

* The total number of votes cast
* The total number of votes for each candidate
* The percentage of votes for each candidate
* The winner of the election based on the popular vote 
* The voter turnout for each county
* The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
* The county with the highest turnout 

The end goal of this audit is to provide a vote-count report to certify this U.S. Congressional race.

### Election Audit Summary
This Python script can be used for future election audits to report the outcomes listed in the "Overview of Election Audit" section. In the future, if the tabulated results are in the same three column (Ballot ID, County, Candidate) CSV file format, then there would be minor modifications needed to the file_to_load and file_to_save variables in order to yield the same results. If the tabulated results are delivered with more columns and information, then additional variables will need to be modified, like the candidate_name or county_name variables. Delivering the tabulated results in the same three column format (Ballot ID, County, Candidate) will help streamline the process in the future. However, if more data or insights are needed, then the script can be edited to satisfy those requirements.
